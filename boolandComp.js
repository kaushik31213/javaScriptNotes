let num1 = 5;
let num2 = 7;

console.log(num1 > num2);

// == and ===
let a = 5;
let b = "5";
console.log(a == b);
//  checks equality only by the value and it is known as loose equality operators

let c = 5;
let d = "5";
console.log(c === d);
// checks both the value and the type of the input and it is known as strict equaltiy operators

// !== and !=

// similar to the top example
