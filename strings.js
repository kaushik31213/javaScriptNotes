let firstName = "Kaushik";

// to find the characters in a string we can use index of the string which accesses all the characters from 0
console.log(firstName[2]);

// we can also find the length of a string
console.log(firstName.length);
// length also calculates the spaces betwwen the string
// lentgh start from 1
// so the last character index is always length-1
