// History of javscript
// ECMASCRIPT
// 1995 web browser netscape navigator
// Brendan Eich created javscript in 10 days where the first name of javascript was Mocha
// He changed the name to livescript again
// At that time there was a very popular language called Java
// So for popularity they changed their name to javascript but they are not same language
// AT that time internet explorer was popular and when they saw javscript getting popular , they picked out some featurees from it and added some of their own and created their own language called Jscript

// SO

// Netscape Navigator ==== JavaScript
// Internet Explorer ==== JScript

// Both in 1996

// Both of this language worked best on their own browser
// JavaScript went to ECMA
// Ecma was a standardised set of rules that suggets how jS should behave or wor
// It could have been called javascript toolbar, but oracle had the trademark
// It is the same as JavaScript but ecma standardizes how javascript should

// In 1997 ES1 came out
// In 2009 ES5 came out
// In 2015 ES6 came out and it is known as modern javascript

// JS is backward compatible which means the features back in 1996 or newer can still be used in modern javascript
// Whereas it is not forward compatible which means you cant use newer features of js in an old machine with old browsers

// BABEL is a tool to transpile a es6 code to older versions so that it works in old browsers
